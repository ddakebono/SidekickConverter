#Borland Sidekick for Mac Phonebook Converter
Simple exporter to convert your Borland Sidekick phonebook from the Macintosh Classic version of the program.

It take only 2 arguments, one being the location of your old phonebook, and the other being the name of the output CSV.

Large phonebook can take a minute to convert, also Sidekick seems to have a tendency to create garbage data in the phonebook file, this program will ignore it but it will show errors when it hits those blocks.

I expect there to be issues here and there, if you hit one drop an issue report.


Please note this program will not convert the phonebook from any Windows, OS/2, or DOS variant of Sidekick.
